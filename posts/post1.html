            <h2 class="h4 mb-3">Introduction</h2>
            <p>Statistics is the science of collecting, analyzing, interpreting, and presenting data. It provides a systematic framework for understanding patterns, making predictions, and drawing meaningful conclusions from information. In an era dominated by data, statistical methods have become essential tools across virtually every field of study and industry.</p>
            <p>Cybersecurity, the practice of protecting systems, networks, and data from digital attacks, increasingly relies on statistical techniques to detect threats, analyze vulnerabilities, and predict security incidents before they occur.</p>

            <h3 class="h5 fw-bold mb-3">Core Concepts</h3>
            <p>Statistics encompasses two main branches: descriptive statistics, which summarizes and describes data characteristics, and inferential statistics, which draws conclusions about populations based on sample data. Key statistical concepts include probability distributions, hypothesis testing, correlation analysis, and regression modeling.</p>

                    <li><strong>Central Tendency:</strong> Mean, median, and mode help identify typical values in datasets</li>
                    <li><strong>Dispersion:</strong> Variance and standard deviation measure data spread</li>
                    <li><strong>Probability:</strong> Quantifies the likelihood of events occurring</li>
                    <li><strong>Correlation:</strong> Identifies relationships between variables</li>

                <h3 class="h5 fw-bold mb-3"><i class="bi bi-1-circle-fill me-2"></i>Anomaly Detection</h3>
                <p>Statistical models establish baseline patterns of normal network behavior. When activity deviates significantly from these patterns, it triggers alerts for potential security threats. Techniques like standard deviation analysis and outlier detection help identify unusual login attempts, data transfers, or system access patterns that may indicate compromised accounts or malicious activity.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="mb-4">
                <h3 class="h5 fw-bold mb-3"><i class="bi bi-2-circle-fill me-2"></i>Threat Intelligence and Risk Assessment</h3>
                <p>Probability theory enables security professionals to assess the likelihood of different types of attacks and prioritize defensive measures accordingly. By analyzing historical attack data, organizations can predict which vulnerabilities are most likely to be exploited and allocate resources effectively.</p>

                <h3 class="h5 fw-bold mb-3"><i class="bi bi-3-circle-fill me-2"></i>Intrusion Detection Systems</h3>
                <p>Modern intrusion detection systems rely heavily on statistical algorithms to differentiate between legitimate traffic and potential attacks. Machine learning models, built on statistical foundations, learn to recognize patterns associated with various types of cyber threats, from DDoS attacks to sophisticated malware.</p>
            </div>

                <h3 class="h5 fw-bold mb-3"><i class="bi bi-4-circle-fill me-2"></i>Malware Analysis</h3>
                <p>Statistical analysis of code patterns helps identify malicious software. By examining frequency distributions of specific code sequences, API calls, or behavioral patterns, security researchers can classify unknown files as benign or malicious with high accuracy.</p>
            </div>

                <h3 class="h5 fw-bold mb-3"><i class="bi bi-5-circle-fill me-2"></i>Security Metrics and Performance Evaluation</h3>
                <p>Organizations use statistical methods to measure the effectiveness of their security controls. Metrics such as mean time to detect (MTTD) and mean time to respond (MTTR) help quantify security posture and guide improvement efforts. Hypothesis testing validates whether security interventions actually reduce incident rates.</p>

                <strong>Example 1: Credit Card Fraud Detection</strong>
            </div>
            <p>Financial institutions use statistical algorithms to analyze transaction patterns in real-time. By building profiles of typical spending behavior for each customer—including transaction amounts, merchant types, geographic locations, and timing—the system can immediately flag transactions that deviate significantly from the norm. For instance, if a credit card normally used for small local purchases suddenly shows large international transactions, statistical models calculate the probability of fraud and may automatically block the transaction pending verification.</p>

                <strong>Example 2: DDoS Attack Mitigation</strong>
            </div>
            <p>Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) attacks attempt to overwhelm servers with traffic. Statistical monitoring systems continuously track metrics like requests per second, connection origins, and traffic patterns. When these metrics exceed statistically significant thresholds—determined using techniques like moving averages and standard deviation analysis—automated defense mechanisms activate to filter malicious traffic while maintaining service for legitimate users.</p>
