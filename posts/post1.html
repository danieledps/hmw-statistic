                    <h2 class="h4 fw-bold mb-3">Introduction</h2>
                    <p>Statistics is the science of collecting, analyzing, interpreting, and presenting data. It provides a systematic framework for understanding patterns, making predictions, and drawing meaningful conclusions from information. In an era dominated by data, statistical methods have become essential tools across virtually every field of study and industry.</p>
                    <p>Cybersecurity, the practice of protecting systems, networks, and data from digital attacks, increasingly relies on statistical techniques to detect threats, analyze vulnerabilities, and predict security incidents before they occur.</p>

                    <h3 class="h5 fw-bold mb-3">Core Concepts</h3>
                    <p>Statistics encompasses two main branches: descriptive statistics, which summarizes and describes data characteristics, and inferential statistics, which draws conclusions about populations based on sample data. Key statistical concepts include probability distributions, hypothesis testing, correlation analysis, and regression modeling.</p>

                    <h2 class="h4 fw-bold mb-4">The Role of Statistics in Cybersecurity</h2>
                    
                    <h3 class="h5 fw-bold mb-3">1. Anomaly Detection</h3>
                    <p>Statistical models establish baseline patterns of normal network behavior. When activity deviates significantly from these patterns, it triggers alerts for potential security threats. Techniques like standard deviation analysis and outlier detection help identify unusual login attempts, data transfers, or system access patterns that may indicate compromised accounts or malicious activity.</p>

                    <h3 class="h5 fw-bold mb-3">2. Threat Intelligence and Risk Assessment</h3>
                    <p>Probability theory enables security professionals to assess the likelihood of different types of attacks and prioritize defensive measures accordingly. By analyzing historical attack data, organizations can predict which vulnerabilities are most likely to be exploited and allocate resources effectively.</p>

                    <h3 class="h5 fw-bold mb-3">3. Intrusion Detection Systems</h3>
                    <p>Modern intrusion detection systems rely heavily on statistical algorithms to differentiate between legitimate traffic and potential attacks. Machine learning models, built on statistical foundations, learn to recognize patterns associated with various types of cyber threats, from DDoS attacks to sophisticated malware.</p>

                    <h3 class="h5 fw-bold mb-3">4. Malware Analysis</h3>
                    <p>Statistical analysis of code patterns helps identify malicious software. By examining frequency distributions of specific code sequences, API calls, or behavioral patterns, security researchers can classify unknown files as benign or malicious with high accuracy.</p>

                    <h3 class="h5 fw-bold mb-3">5. Security Metrics and Performance Evaluation</h3>
                    <p>Organizations use statistical methods to measure the effectiveness of their security controls. Metrics such as mean time to detect (MTTD) and mean time to respond (MTTR) help quantify security posture and guide improvement efforts. Hypothesis testing validates whether security interventions actually reduce incident rates.</p>
